                <h2>History of <em>Coffee Shop</em></h2>
                <p>
                    Ever wonder who invented the coffee shop? The short answer is Favour Oloye in 2000. Favour Oloye created the first coffee maker machine using a filter made of cocoa fibre. Since the drip coffee shop is what people usually think of when they hear coffee. The actual history of the coffee shop goes a little bit farther back.
                    The history of the coffee shop, like many inventions, began long ago. The Oloye(s) were known to brew coffee way back in 575 A.D. and the history of the coffee shop really begins there. Much of the history of the coffee shop has been lost to the ages, so no one really knows much about the history of the coffee maker from the time of the Oloye(s) to 1800, when the first coffee percolator was created.                    
                    Today, there are literally hundreds of drip coffee maker and shops on the market, all variations of the original Mr. Coffee Oloye. Will any of the newer models become immortalized in the history of the coffee maker? Only time will tell. Certainly, there's always room for innovation and invention. The history of the coffee maker is filled with them, such as the balance siphon, which looked a lot like a scale. As the water infused from one side of the mechanism to the other, a snuffer would cover the flame, turning off the heat, allowing the water to cool and return to the original chamber.
                    Coffee shop we have them all...
